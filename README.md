# Happy-Birthday-Website

A responsive website which reponds on changing window size 
,i.e. it shows different layouts on different sized screen devices without taking a hit on performance.
For example, it shows the complete version of the website when viewed from a desktop or laptop computer whereas it shows a slimmer version when viewed from mobile browsers.

This website uses nth-child for the background colors on the sections.
It also features a google maps section for instant clarification of address.
